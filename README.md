Uni Lab work where I make a shooting ships game to learn and develop skills when using input system and physics in unity.

How to Play:
- Try to shoot the aestroids using the SPACE bar
- Move around using WASD or arrow keys
- If you hit an asteroid you lose and the ship is destoryed :(
  - Furthermore aestroids which hit each other destroy each other
